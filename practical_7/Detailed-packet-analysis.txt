Application Layer Packet Analysis using Packet Tracer Tool

Aim: To analyze Application Layer packets (DNS & HTTP) using a packet tracer tool (Wireshark) and understand their structure and working.

Tools Required:
•	Wireshark (Packet Analyzer)
•	Internet Connection or Local DNS/HTTP Server
•	Browser or Command Line Tools (nslookup, ping)
Procedure:
Part A: DNS Packet Analysis
1.	Start Wireshark and begin packet capture on the active network interface (WiFi/Ethernet).
2.	Open Command Prompt or Terminal and type:
3.	nslookup www.google.com
4.	In Wireshark, stop the capture after response.
5.	Apply filter:
6.	dns
7.	Select the DNS query and observe the following:
o	Transaction ID
o	Flags: Query/Response
o	Query Name: e.g., www.google.com
o	Query Type: A (IPv4)
8.	Click on the DNS Response packet and observe:
o	Resolved IP Address
o	TTL (Time to Live)
o	Answer Section
Part B: HTTP Packet Analysis
1.	In the browser, type:
2.	http://example.com
3.	In Wireshark, apply filter:
4.	http
5.	Observe the HTTP GET request:
o	Method: GET
o	Host: example.com
o	User-Agent
6.	Observe the HTTP Response:
o	Status Code: 200 OK
o	Content-Type: text/html
o	Content-Length
Observations:
Field	DNS Query	DNS Response	HTTP Request	HTTP Response
Protocol	UDP	UDP	TCP	TCP
Port	53	53	80	80
Method/Type	Standard Query (A Record)	Response	GET /	200 OK
IP Address Queried	www.google.com	e.g., 142.250.77.68	example.com	IP of example.com
TTL	-	300 seconds (example)	-	-
Content-Type	-	-	-	text/html
Result:
Successfully analyzed DNS and HTTP packets using Wireshark. The structure and fields of Application Layer packets were observed and interpreted.

 Conclusion:
•	DNS resolves domain names to IP addresses via UDP port 53.
•	HTTP works over TCP port 80, where the client sends a GET request and receives a response with status and content.
•	Wireshark effectively captures and visualizes Application Layer communication for analysis and troubleshooting.
